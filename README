haskal is the haskell shell.

here is a basic configuration file for
the shell:

   config = defaultConfig
      { prompt   = mkPrompt [ user, at, host, ConfigAPI.colon
                            , currentDir, rangle ]
      , dir      = "~/.haskal"
      , verbose  = False
      }

Put this in ~/.haskal/Config.hs and run haskal.

see src/Haskal/ConfigAPI.hs for available features. the
file src/config_stub includes the basic stub that is
included in every configuration and it shows the imports
given to you.

improvements welcome.
